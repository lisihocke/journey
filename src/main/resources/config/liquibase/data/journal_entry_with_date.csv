1;2018-03-31;First run!;Ran 6 kilometers today. Not much, yet I ran :)
2;2018-04-02;Next run;I was eager to go running the last days yet time just did not allow it. Need to find a way to balance my time
3;2018-04-03;Yay, two days in a row!;Phew, this was a tough one! Muscles still tired from yesterday. Lesson learned: in the beginning it's better to have a day off in between to give my body time to recover.
4;2018-04-05;I have a run;It's going well! A lot better today with the day off in between. I feel I'm getting better. Already eager to increase my mileage, yet I know I should not do this too early on.
5;2018-04-08;Discipline;It was going so well! And then the last days I found way too many excuses... Really need to get more disciplined.
6;2018-04-11;On the road again;New start. I reduced my mileage a bit in favor of first getting used to run more frequently each week.
7;2018-04-13;Yes!!;Keeping going. Less mileage seems to have been a good choice so far.
8;2018-04-14;The importance of equipment;Did not go running today, yet went to a running shop and got consulting on picking my next running shoes. I probably should have done this before starting the challenge, as I need to first get used to the new shoes. Slowly. No long distances for me yet.
9;2018-04-16;Picked shoes;I've decided on my shoes now. They feel really good! Supporting my body, and also perfect for the ground I'm usual running on.
10;2018-04-18;First run with new shoes;Oh my, these shoes are simply awesome!!! I feel I could run super long with them. Need to hold back yet, but super happy!
11;2018-04-20;Progress;Even though I could not yet go running for a long distance, I already feel I'm making progress. Also, I did some additional workout and it seems it really supports my goal.
12;2018-04-22;Keep going!;I finally could increase my weekly mileage! Just a bit, yet still I'm happy to move another step towards my goal.
