1;marathon;Running a marathon was always on my bucket list. I'm running quite regularly yet never really tried to find out where my limits are. Also, I'm healthy and in good shape these days, so now's the time to tackle this challenge!;I believe that increasing my mileage each week will result in me getting fit enough to run a marathon. I know I'll have succeeded when I have indeed managed to run a whole marathon!;I go running three to five times per week. I increase my mileage not every run, but every week. I do a longer run every two weeks to adjust to longer distances. In case I find a better training plan for marathon beginners I will adapt my probe where it makes sense. I keep a training log using this journal. I will take a break every fourth week.;I will pause the probe as soon as I realize that I pushed my body over its limits and only continue when I have fully recovered.;If I did not succeed within one year, or if I get injured or sick I will stop and reflect.;My mother ran three marathons in her life, and now my best friend is training for one, too.;Note to myself: get a decent pair of running shoes! Check the rest of your running equipment as well.
2;the next big challenge;Here goes your challenge description.;Come up with a measurable hypothesis!;Define a probe to test the hypothesis. Make it as concrete as possible!;When to pause this probe?;When to stop and reflect?;Who did influence you when defining your challenge or how to tackle it?;Any additional notes?
